        # Sample 3: Business Email Compromise
        """Subject: Urgent Wire Transfer Required - Confidential Acquisition Deal

Hi [Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm currently in meetings with potential investors in Singapore regarding the confidential acquisition deal we discussed last month. I apologize for the short notice, but we need to move quickly on this opportunity.

Due to the sensitive nature of these negotiations and the time difference, I need you to handle an urgent wire transfer on behalf of the company. The investors require a good faith deposit to proceed with the due diligence process, and all communications must remain strictly confidential until the deal is finalized.

TRANSFER DETAILS:
Amount: $85,000.00 USD
Recipient: Singapore International Holdings Pte Ltd
Bank: DBS Bank Singapore
Account Number: 003-901-567-8
Swift Code: DBSSSGSG
Reference: Acquisition Deposit - Project Mercury

Please process this transfer immediately using our corporate account ending in 4892. The investors' legal team has confirmed this is standard procedure for transactions of this magnitude in Singapore.

I understand this is a significant amount, but this acquisition could potentially increase our company valuation by 300-400% within the next 18 months. The investors represent a consortium of venture capital firms with a combined portfolio worth over $2.8 billion.

IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:
- Do not discuss this transfer with anyone else in the company
- Do not copy accounting or finance on this email
- Process the transfer through our priority business banking portal
- Send confirmation receipt to this email address only

Time is critical as the investors are meeting with competitors tomorrow. I need the transfer completed and confirmed by 5:00 PM EST today to secure our position in the negotiations.

Best regards,
